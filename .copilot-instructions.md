# Copilot Instructions for GoSnel Landing Pages

## Project Overview
This project contains the landing pages for the main GoSnel application. It serves as the promotional and onboarding interface for different user types accessing GoSnel.

## Project Structure
- **Main Purpose**: Landing pages for GoSnel subdomains
- **Target Domains**: 
  - `user.gosnel.com` → User landing page
  - `vendor.gosnel.com` → Restaurant/vendor landing page  
  - `drivers.gosnel.com` → Driver landing page
  - `promo.gosnel.com` → Promotional campaigns page

## References Folder
The `References/` folder contains essential resources from the main GoSnel project:
- **JSX Components**: Original React components for reference (`UserLanding.jsx`, `VendorLanding.jsx`, `DriverLanding.jsx`)
- **API Endpoints**: Complete documentation of main app routes and endpoints
- **Translations**: EN/AR localization strings and patterns
- **Assets**: Favicons, icons, images, and branding materials
- **Routing Logic**: How the main app handles subdomain routing

## Development Guidelines
When working on landing pages:

1. **Use References for Accuracy**: Always check `References/` folder for:
   - Correct API endpoint URLs
   - Translation strings and localization patterns
   - Proper favicon and asset references
   - Main app routing structure

2. **Maintain Consistency**: Landing pages should:
   - Match the design and functionality of JSX references
   - Use identical endpoint URLs to the main app
   - Include proper EN/AR translations with RTL support
   - Implement the same user flows and redirects

3. **Asset Management**: 
   - Copy needed assets from `References/` to `src/assets/`
   - Use proper favicon references from References folder
   - Ensure all images and icons are optimized

4. **Routing & Endpoints**:
   - All login/signup buttons should point to main app: `gosnel.com/user/login`, `gosnel.com/vendor/signup`, etc.
   - Footer links should use correct main app paths
   - Landing pages are promotional only - actual functionality is in main app

5. **Translations**:
   - Implement client-side EN/AR switching
   - Use translation dictionaries from JSX references
   - Support RTL layout for Arabic
   - Maintain text parity between EN/AR versions
